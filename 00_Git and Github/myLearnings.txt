So jab bhi ap ek folder banate ho to git to kuch nahi pata apke folder ke bare me.
Issliye ap wha pe git ko initialize karte ho.

Ab git ko permissions mili hai to git apke folder ko pehchanta hai.
Ab jab git hamare folder pr kaam kar sakta hai to git 
            untracked
            tracked
            modified
            staged
            saved checkpoint 
create kar sakta hai. 

Git can perfrom some interesting tasks like

➡️ checking which file is in which state -> git status -s
➡️ checking how many saved checkpoint are available -> git log --oneline --graph
➡️

Git status sirf unka status bataega jo files commited nahi hai aur jo commit hone ke baad change ki gayi hai.
Git status batata hai files ke changes ke bare me aur uske status ke barre me. before commit or after commit.


We can create a branch using git branch (name of the branch to be created)
Also we can check how many branches are available -> git branch 
To change the branch we can use -> git switch (name of the branch)
Now i am in components/react/Sambhav branch.

How to delete a branch is by using -> git branch -d (name of the branch to be deleted)

We can create and switch a branch at same time using -> git switch -C (name of the branch)

We can stash a branch using -> git stash  
So to see those changes again we can use -> git stash apply
We can use -> git stash clear (to remove all the saved changes.)
