1. Inline element won't allow you to increase width and height. If you want
    to increase its width and height then you have to give it (DISPLAY INLINE BLOCK) property.

2. Block element won't allow anyone to come in its line because it takes all the height and width available in its own block.
    You can also give width and height to them.

3. Inline Element allow's you to come in it's row so that elements can stay together but
    you cannot increase its width and height.


4. We have a background property in CSS
    It helps us to keep a background image on our webpage.
    background-image: url(image address)
    background-size: cover [It makes the image more clear and more visible]
    background-size: contain [It includes full image in the div if it gets repeted or not considered]
    background-position: center [It makes the image show center part of the image.]
    background-repeat: none [stops the image from repeting]

    background: linear-gradient(to right, color1, color2)

    pseudo-classes
    :hover - when we move our cursor over anything.
    :active - when we click on something then it works.
