#Responsive Website using HTML and CSS


➡️ Landscape Screen on Laptop 
➡️ Portrait Screen on Phone

1. Understanding Units

- px ➡️ [Pixels do not change their size if screen size is changed or parents size is changed. They are of fixed size.]
- % ➡️ [Percents changes according to height and width of their parents of screen size.]
- vw ➡️ ["viewport-width"], vh ["viewport-height"]. [It depends on total width and height of our Screen.]
- vmax, vmin ➡️ [it adjusts itself according to the maximum and minimum viewport on particular device.]
for example ➡️ if you have Laptop then your vmax will be your viewport width but as soon as you shift on phone your vmax would be your viewport height and this changes according to our devices.
- em, rem ➡️ [when using EM we give fontsize to parent]
for example if parent has 50px as fontsize then child if given 1em will be considered as 50px.

➡️ [ when using REM we have font size according to Root Element and 1 REM is equal to 16px]
