vite vs create react app 
➡️ What happend is that with create react app we can create react application but now new things has been added to it like next.js and other stuff
so we need to make sure that we use pure react while learning for that purpose we use vite instead of create react app.

We have done installation and setup  of react application.

jsx -> jsx is actually a very similar looking structure like HTML but with superpowers.
